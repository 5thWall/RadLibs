<% content_for :title do %>Create a new Radlibs Template!<% end %>
<h3>New Template</h3>
<br />
<h5>How its done:</h5>

<p><strong>You write a story and anything put between {{brackets}} will become a blank input field for the people filling out your radlib.</strong></p>
<hr>

<strong>Tips:</strong>
<br />
<p>Try to give the user a hint<em> eg. His name was{{name}}....the {{vehicle}} approached {{adverb}}...The cat ate so much {{food_type}} it eventually just {{action}}</em></p>

<p>Make sure you don't put spaces between your {{bracketed_words}} use an _underscore_ instead. </p>

<hr width="325px">

<p>
  Enter your story here. To create space for people to fill in words use double
  brackets, like this: <span class='markup_example'>{{Noun}}</span>. To create a
  space where the text should be the same each time, just add a number to the
  end, like this: <span class='markup_example'>{{Name1}}</span>. Please no
  spaces between the brackets.
