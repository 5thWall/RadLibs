# Example Stories

This is a list of stories to use as examples when developing the application.

## How To Use

The stories come in pairs of `.mustache` and `.json` files. The `.mustache`
file should be copied into the template text area. The `.json` file is the raw
JSON formatted data that should be placed in the `words` field in a Radlibs
entry attached to the previously defined template.
